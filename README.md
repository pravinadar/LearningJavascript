# LearningJavascript
## Overview
This repository contains the code snippets from my recent revision journey through JavaScript. I covered a wide range of topics, from basic concepts to more advanced features. In the later files, I leveraged AI to generate concise comments, ensuring that I retain the key points in the long run.

## Topics Covered
1_basics: Basic syntax and operations in JavaScript.
2_Arrays: Working with arrays, including common methods.
3_Objects: Understanding objects and their properties.
4_Objects2: Advanced object concepts.
5_functions: Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
6_arrowFunction: Introduction to arrow functions.
7_iife: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.
8_all_loops: Overview of different looping mechanisms.
9_map_method: Using map for array transformations.
10_filter_method: Using filter to create new arrays.
11_map_method: Another look at the map method.
12_reduce_method: Summarizing array elements with reduce.
13_1_Promises: Handling asynchronous operations with Promises.
14_OOP: Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
15_prototype: Exploring prototypes in JavaScript.
16_call: Understanding and using call.
17_Classes: ES6 classes and how they work.
18_know_about_inheritance: Inheritance in JavaScript.
19_bind: Using bind to control this.
20_getter_setter: Using getters and setters for object properties.
20.2_getter_setter: A deeper dive into getters and setters.

## AI-Powered Comments
In the later files, I used AI to generate concise comments that summarize the key points of the code. These comments serve as a quick reference to help me recall the concepts and logic implemented in each snippet.

## How to Use
