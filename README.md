## More
If you have a solid understanding of these JavaScript topics, you're well-prepared to move on to learning any frontend or backend frameworks in JavaScript. This journey assumes you're already familiar with foundational concepts like lexical scoping, execution context, stack and heap memory management, scope levels, control flow, and more.
